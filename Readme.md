## My 2 cents
I cannot discover some parts of https://github.com/UWP-Team/dolphinUWP solution 
(main dolphinUWP.vcxproj, for example). 
 So, I'm trying to find and get similar projects from another repo (https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin),
etc.  

## Status / Progress

## System Requirements
### Desktop
* OS
    * Windows 10
    * Xbox One - compatible win. os build (17xxx?)
* Processor
    * A CPU with SSE2 support.
    * A modern CPU (3 GHz and Dual Core, not older than 2008) is highly recommended.
* Graphics
    * A reasonably modern graphics card (Direct3D 10.0 / OpenGL 3.0).
    * A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11 / OpenGL 4.4 is recommended.

## Building for Windows
Use the solution file `Source/DolphinUWP.sln` to build Dolphin on Windows.
Visual Studio 2022 is a hard requirement. Other compilers might be
able to build Dolphin on Windows but have not been tested and are not
recommended to be used. Git and Windows 10 SDK 10.0.15063.0 must be installed when building.
